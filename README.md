# ðŸ“‚ File Handling in C

This repository is my collection of **file handling programs in C** â€” from the very basics to more advanced use cases.  

Right now, Iâ€™m focusing on the **core concepts** like:
- Opening and closing files
- Reading and writing data (text and binary)
- Moving the file pointer
- Basic error handling

---

## ðŸš€ Goal
To build a solid understanding of how files work in C, starting small and gradually adding more complex examples.

---

## ðŸ“œ What's Inside
- Basic file read/write programs
- Binary file handling
- File pointer operations (`fseek`, `ftell`)
- Error checking for file operations

---

## ðŸ›  Status
Currently working on **basic examples**.  
More examples and use cases will be uploaded over time â€” including:
- Appending to files
- Working with structured data (like `struct`s in binary files)
- Parsing CSV-like files
- Creating and managing log files

---

ðŸ“Œ **Note:**  
Every program in this repo is written in **pure C** using standard library functions from `<stdio.h>`.  
No fancy libraries â€” just the raw basics done right.

## ðŸ“¬ Contributions
If you have an interesting file handling example or improvement, feel free to fork and open a pull request.

## ðŸ“… Updates
Stay tuned! More examples are on the way as I continue building and testing them.
